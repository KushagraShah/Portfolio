# Industry Work Experience

## Huawei – Munich, Bavaria, Germany
(Senior Research Engineer, Jul 2023 – Present)

### AI4Sec Team
(Senior Research Engineer, Aug 2024 - Present)

Working on Next-Generation Firewall System in the Applied Networking Technologies Laboratory, Munich Research Center.

> Primary project

* Currently, implementing and optimizing an ML-based zero-day phishing detector module in C for the Huawei Next-Generation Firewall System-on-Chip Devices.
* Leading the system design of the project while coordinating the high-level design of Brand Imitation, CRP Detection and CNN inference components with the team.
* Responsible for code development, unit testing and performance benchmarking of the E2E prototype in a mock of the production environment. Simultaneously, mentoring an intern who is assisting in the aforementioned tasks.
* Conducted in-depth analysis of the product code, prepared technical documentation, and delivered multiple presentations to the team and stakeholders to improve technical understanding.

> Secondary project 1

* Implemented a Python component to identify the represented/imitated brand from the HTML content of benign/phishing credential request pages. 
* The component was optimized to run in a fast streaming mode using the Hyperscan pattern matching engine. Achieved a 96% precision, 70% recall with a minimal runtime less than 1 ms.

> Secondary project 2

* Performed extensive benchmarking between different implementations of a CNN inference pipeline. The benchmark included testing various datasets, analyzing specific samples, debugging intermediate vectors and theorizing the expected performance of various inference engines and pre-processing methodologies. 
* Improved the pre-processing logic, feature vector generation, buffering methodologies etc. to meet the performance requirements from our stakeholders.

> Tertiary projects

* Conducted data analysis on various open-source and internal datasets containing HTML content for benign and phishing sites. Prepared a conclusive report to highlight patterns which would assist the development of machine learning features.
* Completed several DevOps tasks for a prototype demo to stakeholders: designed HTML pages, simulated phishing attacks, set up MITM proxy, ran web-scraping bots, set up pytest infrastructure and GitLab CI/CD pipeline.

> Other responsibilities

* Conducted thorough research in the fields of networking, web security, machine learning, and phishing attack prevention.
* Assisted in interviewing, onboarding and supporting new full-time members and interns for the team.
* Represented the technical team at the Huawei Network Summit 2024, assisting the marketing team and engaging with customers.
* Coordinated project direction, targets and product integration details with stakeholders during business trip to China.

### Storage4AI Team
(Senior Research Engineer, Jul 2023 – Jul 2024)

Worked on Next-Generation Data Infrastructure in the Intelligent Cloud Technologies Laboratory, Munich Research Center.

> Primary project

* Researched, prototyped and delivered a vector+scalar composite index for a distributed multi‑tenant vector database in Huawei Cloud.
* Led the solo project, taking full responsibility for development and delivery while incorporating valuable feedback from the team and stakeholders.
* Achieved up to 5x performance improvement compared to the state‑of‑the‑art HNSW index, while maintaining similar accuracy and index size.

> Secondary project

* Improved the debuggability of a Spark‑based system by collecting relevant statistics on run‑time and updating the history server web interface.

> Other responsibilities

* Conducted thorough research in the fields of databases, distributed systems and vector storage.
* Presented deep dive sessions and participated in discussions to decide project directions.
* Coordinated project milestones and goals with stakeholders during business trip to China.
